# DevSecOps

It stands for **Development, Security and Operations**. It's like DevOps but it integrates security into every stage of the software development lifecycle. The main characteristic that I see, is that we have to ensure that security is a shared reponsability among all members of the development an operations teams, rather than being handles by a separate security team at the end of the development process.

## The DevOps

In general, DevOps aims to imporve collaboration between teams to speed up softwaredelivery. Ephatizing automation, continous delivery an integration (CD/CI) to streamline the developmet pipeline.

I commonly had heard of DevOps with a friend of mine, he told me about how he had to use Java with hist team writting new features and fixing bugs for a Personal Finances App. In Continuous Integration the team merged their code into a GitLab repository, then, they ran automated tests to ensure new code doesn't breakexisting functionality. And in Continuous Delivery, once the code passed all tests, it was automatically deployed to a stagin enviroment for further testing. Then the operations team monitors the app's performance and handles any issues that arise in production. Finally, the security team performed security checks before the app is realed to users and any vulnerabilities found are addressed at this stage.

## DevOps vs DevSecOps

DevOps focueses on speed and efficiency, with security offten added at the end, in the other side, DevSecOpd integrates security into every step, makin it a priority from the starts.

For example, when a ship is being build a captain sends the bests crew members to make sure that the ship is strong and ready to face any storm or pirate attack, but also makin security a responsability of everyone.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

The developers merge their code changes to a shared repository, each time code is meged, automated tests run to catch any bugs or issues early. This ensures that the codebase remains stable and functional.

## Continous Delivery (CD)

It comes after CI, it automates teh process of deploying code changes to a staging or production envitoment. This means that the software is always in a deplyable state, and updates can be realesed quickly and reliably. It's like a document that is automatically formatted and ready to be printed.

## Pipeline

Is a series of atomated steps thate take the code from the developers computer to the production enviroment. You make sure that every peace of code is tested and checked for security, so it can be send to production without any trouble.

## Pentesting

It stands for **Penetration testing**, involves testing the security of an application or system whileit's still being built. So you can identify and fix security vuknerabilities on the development process.

### In development

Security experts simulate attacks on the system to finde weaknesses. These tests can include: code reviews, vulnerability scans and manual testing.

### In production

This ensures that the live system is secure and can withstand real-world attacks. The attacks that can be includes are network scans, application testing and social engeneering attacks.

## GCP

Google Cloud PLatform is a site of cloud computing servies provided by Google. It offers a range of services including computing power, storage, databases, machine learnig and networking, al hosted in Googles Infraestrucutre.

### Services

Offers various services taht can be mixed and matched to build, deploy, and manage applications. These services incude virtual machines, managed databases, data analitycs, AI tools and more. The access is throught a web-based console, command-line tools or API's, allowing for flexible and automated managemtn od resorces.

### Uses

- Application development
- Data Storage and Management
- Machine Learnig and AI
- Data Aanalytics
- Networking

In summary, GCP provides a comprehensive set of tools and services to help businesses build, deploy, and scale applications efficiently and securely.

## Azure

It offers a wide range of cloud services by Microsoft, as computing, analytics, storage and networking.

It offers Infrastrucutre-as-aServices (IaaS), Platform-as-a-SeRVICE (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) options

### What can be done with Azure

- Application developmente
- Data storage and management
- Machine Learnig and AI
- Data Aanalytics
- Networking

### My experience with azure

I use Azure in a Distribuited Systems subject, i learn to configure servers, i worked with Ubuntu Servers and Windows Servers. I made images of the system, i made a database service. Fourtunaly i never had a viturtal machine working witout knowing.

## Security

### My experience with security

I've made an application thar privides an authentication service and a digital sign tool. I used the cipher algorthtm AES but I also know RSA and DES.

I've actually made an DES cipher from zero in highschool with Java, it was a tourture.

## My java experience

It was the first language that I learned. I've made web services, web applications, desktop applications (As a photo editor), mobile applications, some basic games and a compiler

## My python experience

This is my favorite language, i actually made my bachelords final project with it, it's about a job interview simullator that scanns you face with facial recognition technologies and gives you a report about the emotions you've show during the simulation to help you improve your softskills.

Actualli, i've used a lot of TkIner (A pyhton framework) to design graohic interfaces, i've also made a panel control to manage a greenhousethrough a humidity sensor, a ventilaor and a irrigation system.

## SCA

Software Composition Analysis, is a security practice used to identify and manage vulnerabilities ub the software components that make up application.

It exams opensorce libraries and third-party code, to detect anu known security vulnerabuilites. To ensure all componets are secure and up-to-date, reducing security creaches.

You use SCA tools to scan the app and identify all the software components and create an inventory, often referred to as a Software Bill of Materials The tool check each component against known vulnerabilitiy databases, such as the Common Culnerabilities an Exposures (CVE) database. The results are compiled into a repor, highlightinh any vulnerabilities and providen recommendations

The steps are:

- Component identification
- Vulnerability Scanning
- Reporting and Management

It also ensures that the software complies with secuity standards and regulations. Provides ongoing monitoring of software components to detect new vulnerabilitiens as ther arise.

## Tekton

Is an open source framework for creating Continuous Integration and Continous Delivery systems.

It build, test and deplo applications across carious enviroments. It contains components as pipelines, triggers, CLI and dashbords

### How it works

- **Pipelines**: Provide building blocks for defining CI/CD workflows. These pipeline are made up of tasks that can be reused and customized.
- **Triggers**: Allow pipelines to be automatically satarted based on events, such as new code commit or a pull request.
- **CLI and Dashboard**: Command-line INterface and dashborad provide tools fot managing an visualizng the execution of pipelines.

## IaC

Infraestrucutre as Code. Infrasturcure is provisined and managed using code, rather than through manual processes

You can define a infractructure with cod, therefore youcan vesionated it, test it and reuse it. So you can automate teh setup and managemt of infraestrucutre making it consistent repateable an effciente

Aazure has "Azure Resoruce Manager" which allows to define and manage infraestrucute across variou providers.

### Pro's

- Provisinf aotomaticaly set up server, databases and networks
- Consisteny
- Scalability
- Disaster recovery

## DAST

Dinamic Application Security Testing, is a security testing method used to identify vulnerabilities in web applications, API's and mobile apps by simulating attacks from the outside.

## My team work abilities

I work well in a team, i like to distribute tasks using a divide and conquest strategy so we can attack a problen with efficiency.

I'm not a lider, but i like to colaborate and get along with others. At start i'm introvert but with time i get to adapt with moslty of the teams i've worked with.

I'm always try to give all the information i have to ensure that im in the same page. Also i'm an active listener, i try my best to undestangind other point of views.

But most important i want to understan and share the feeelings of others, i think this makes a cohesive team enviroment
